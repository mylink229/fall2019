Multithreading
	-each thread has its own stack
	-new life cycle => new state => runnable 
				()=> waiting  (notify // notify all)
				()=> time waiting (wait step)
				()=> terminated  (task completes)
				()=> block  (enter synchronized, interrupt)
	-thread priority (Executor interface)
	-deadlock means that threads cannot continue due to a chain reaction of threads
	being stuck
	-needs to implement Runnable

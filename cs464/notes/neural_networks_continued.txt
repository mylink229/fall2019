		**PyTorch machine learning library?
		**tensorflow.com?

written with J Notebook in Python

used multiple libraries
	-check on Canvas
	-MLPClassifier class

we need to scale the data from [0,1] 
	-divide datatset by 255
	-// i think he said ACII values?
	-// do not change learning_rate when training

PYTHON
(trainX, testX, trainY, testY) = train_test_split(dataset.data/255.0, dataset.target.astype("int0")

rules of convergence

MODEL STUFF
	data > preprocess > create model > train (fit) > test (predict) percentage

-// what are precision and recall values? this has to do something when evaluating the values that we are predicting?

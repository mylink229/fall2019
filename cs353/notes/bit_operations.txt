a bit can mean one of a pair of characteristics

16 color scheme => 4bits for each pixel

RGB => 0-255, 8bits


BIT OPERATIONS
	-1 bit operations

	-C uses ! for logical not
	-C uses ~ for a bit-wise not
		!0 == 1
		!1 == 0
		~0 == 1
		~1 == 0

	-assembly
		not rax ;
		not dward [x]

	-C uses & for logical and
	-C uses && for bit-wise and
	-// we can use the bit-wise operator to select bits
		11001100b & 00001111b = 00001100b
		0xabcdefab & 0xff == 0xab (1010 a, 1011 b)

	-assembly
		and rbx, 0xf

		#dividing, 0x12345678 by 16
		#find remainder, put it into another register
		rdx <= 0
		idiv rcx

	-C uses | for logical or
	-C uses || for bit-wise  or (bit setter)

SHIFT OPERATIONS
	-shifting left or right
	- use, << or >> , left to multiply by power 2, right is divide by power 2

FILLING A FIELD
	-2 ways to fill a field
	-you can shift the field and a mask and then use them
		[a][b][c]     -// want to keep [b] and [c] intact, but change b
			-// mask of m - k + 1 
	-// need to check out rotating:w

(assembly)
	bts qword[set], 4  => tests the bit, then sets the bit group value
	bts qword[set+8], 4  => [set+8], gets the bits at [set] but then moves 8 bits to the right, sets 8th bit to 4?
	setc dl  => whatever carry flag value is, it'll set it in dl register
	
	(temp variable//variable value swapping algorithm -- like other sorting algorithms)
	a = a^b
	b = a^b
	a = a^b

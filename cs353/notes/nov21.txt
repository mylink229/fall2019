loops:

for:	cmp	rcx, rdx
	...	..	..	
	...	..	..	
	## need this jmp
	jmp	...	..	
end_for:

rep movsb  => repeat move string byte, but need to do: mov rcx, VALUE; before using: rep movsb;

mov eax, 1
mov ecx, 1,000,000
lea	rdi, [desitnation]
rep	stosd (store string double word)


loadsb (also works, load string byte)
scasb (scan string byte)

when storing strings into 2 registers, then subtract, it'll get the difference of the two strings (numeric value of change)
